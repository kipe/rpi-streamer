# Raspberry Zero W Streamer
This is simple Python HTTP server, designed to be run with [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) on a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), equipped with a [camera](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-night-vision-camera?variant=20063164235838).

## Security
This project is more or less designed to be used as part of another project, so __no security features have been added__.
So be especially aware, if using this directly, without a frontend webserver with authentication.
